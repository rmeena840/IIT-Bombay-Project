<h2>Multiple lenses experiment concepts</h2>
<h3>About the experiment</h3>
<p>The experiment shows a how can we calculate Equivalent power of Multiple lenses.</p>
<h3>Power</h3>
<p>The power of a lens is defined as the reciprocal of its focal length in meters, or D = 1/f, where D is the power in diopters and f is the focal length in meters.</p>

<h3>The Formula:</h3>
<p>Power if given as, P= 1/f</p>
<p>Equivalent Power of lens is give as, P=P(1)+P(2).....</p>

<h3>Points to remember:</h3>
<p>* Concave lens have negative focal length.</p>
<p>* Convex lens have positive focal length.</p>
<h2>Happy Experimenting</h2>
